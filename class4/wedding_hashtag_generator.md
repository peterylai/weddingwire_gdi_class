In pairs, add [Wedding Hashtag generator](http://mktg.weddingwire.com/wedding-hashtag-generator/) functionality to your Sinatra app.

- `/generator` should display the form that collects information
- `/hashtag` should display the randomly generated Wedding hashtag

1. Get it to print a single (unaltered) name submitted in the form first
2. Submit two names, and get it to print "#Name1LovesName2" on the page
3. Add a few more hashtags options that it randomly chooses between

#### Bonus:

4. Add styling to make it look good
5. Allow users to submit additional information like nicknames, the date of their wedding, or the location of their wedding, and incorporate that information into potential hashtags
6. Get creative and include some extra "easter eggs" (for example display a fun gif if the have the same name as you)
