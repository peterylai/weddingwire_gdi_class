<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>Angela Winter started Sweet Teensy in Bend, Oregon, then relocated in 2010 to a commercial kitchen in Bethesda, Maryland. Much earlier, after college and years of treating friends and co-workers to boatloads of cookies and cupcakes, Angela set out to create the perfect recipe for each of her cookie and cake products. Dozens and dozens of test samples later, Sweet Teensy came to life. Sweet Teensy now offers the freshest and tastiest baked goods available in the Washington DC metro area and for shipping across the country.</p>

<p>Sweet Teensy uses only premium ingredients, resulting in a luscious blend of refined flavors. Hand-crafted, small-batch-from-scratch Sweet Teensy cookies, cupcakes and custom cakes are a delight in every exquisite biteâ€“the perfect gift for friends, associates and loved ones. The best flour, rich chocolate and natural flavorings are blended with farm-fresh eggs and pure creamery butter to create a sublime sensation. Sweet Teensy baked goods are free of trans fats, preservatives and artificial colorings. Whole-hearted foods, artfully packaged, just for you!</p>
